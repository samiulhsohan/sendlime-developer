# Numbers

## Overview

Numbers are a key concept to understand when working with the SendLime API. The following points should be considered before developing your SendLime Application.

## Formatting

Within the SendLime API all numbers are in E.164 format. This means that numbers:
- Omit both a leading `+` and the international access code such as `00` or `001`.
- Contain no special characters, such as a space, `()` or `-`

For example, would have the format `8801751111992`.
