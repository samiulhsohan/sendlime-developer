# Getting Started

Welcome to the SendLime API platform! SendLime provides a suite of APIs that enable you to communicate with your customers using your preferred channels.

This site provides comprehensive documentation for all of our APIs and you’ll find everything you need to know about working with a particular API in the corresponding section.

However, there are some fundamental concepts that you need to understand and tools that might help you that apply across all our APIs. Here, we'll give you this information and get you up and running as quickly as possible.

**What you will learn:**
- [Signing up for an account](#signing-up-for-an-account)
- [Accessing the Developer Dashboard](#accessing-the-developer-dashboard)
- [Using a Server SDK](#using-a-server-sdk)

## Signing up for an account
To work with our APIs, you will need to [sign up for an account](https://www.sendlime.com). This will give you an API key and secret that you can use to access our APIs.

## Accessing the Developer Dashboard
Once you have an account, you can log into the [Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.sendlime.com). The Developer Dashboard is a GUI-based approach to managing your account, where you can:

- **View your API key and secret.** You will need these to authenticate your requests to our APIs
- **Manage your account balance.** Access to our APIs is charged on a per-request basis. We’ll give you some free credit when you first open your account and you can top up when you run low.
- **Buy numbers or register brand/masking.** You can use virtual numbers or masks to send messages.
- **Manage your account.** You can perform other administration tasks here.

## Using a Server SDK
When you are ready to start building your app, you’ll want to use one of our Server SDKs instead of coding each request by hand. We have SDKs for the following programming languages:

- [Node.js](https://github.com/SendLime/sendlime-sdk-node)
- [Java](https://github.com/SendLime/sendlime-sdk-java)
